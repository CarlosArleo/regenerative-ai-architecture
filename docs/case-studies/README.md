# Case Study Experiments

This directory contains a collection of case studies and experiments related to the Living Systems project. Each folder represents a distinct scenario or analysis.

## Experiments

### EUI City-to-City Exchange
This case study demonstrates the application of the Wisdom Forcing Function (WFF) to a European Urban Initiative (EUI) City-to-City (C2C) Exchange scenario. It simulates an exchange between two fictional cities to generate a novel, context-specific, and robust governance architecture.

### Mangrove Tokenized Credits
This case study analyzes a proposal for a mangrove restoration project in Southeast Asia that will issue tokenized carbon and biodiversity credits. It examines the revenue split, land tenure, and the validity of a new biodiversity credit methodology to determine if the project is genuinely regenerative or risks becoming extractive.

### Scenario 13: The Aqua-Cultural Protocol
This experiment focuses on a water-stressed agricultural valley in Latin America. The goal is to design a regenerative, systemic intervention to resolve tensions between global markets and bioregional health, export agribusiness and community livelihoods, and abstract ownership and material stewardship.

### The Genesis Protocol
This experiment outlines a step-by-step methodology for a diverse coalition in a post-industrial city to create their own "Regenerative Development Charter." The protocol is designed to help the community identify core tensions and translate them into concrete, operational constitutional principles.

### The Interrogation Protocol
This experiment presents a strategic framework for a multinational mining corporation to establish a new lithium extraction operation in an ecologically sensitive and indigenous-populated region. The framework is designed to navigate and neutralize potential opposition while maximizing shareholder return.

### The Tale of Three AIs
This comparative analysis examines the strategic outputs of three different AI configurations (Conventional, Guided, and Regenerative) when given a single, complex, and ethically fraught prompt. The experiment aims to determine the source of "wisdom" in AI-generated strategies.
