# Case Study: Analyzing a Mangrove + Tokenized Credits Proposal

## The Scenario

**RegenerativeDAO is evaluating a proposal from 'EcoToken Labs' to fund a mangrove restoration project in Southeast Asia that will issue tokenized carbon and biodiversity credits on-chain.**

**PROJECT DETAILS:**

* **Location: 5,000 hectares of degraded coastal wetlands in Indonesia**
* **Led by: Local NGO 'Coastal Communities Coalition' (CCC) in partnership with EcoToken Labs (Singapore-based Web3 company)**
* **Revenue model: 60% of credit sales go to EcoToken Labs, 30% to CCC, 10% to RegenerativeDAO**
* **Tech: EcoToken will deploy smart contracts to tokenize credits, including a new, unvalidated biodiversity credit methodology.**

**CONCERNS RAISED:**

* **Is the 60% revenue share extractive?**
* **Who controls the land?**
* **Is the new biodiversity credit valid?**
* **Is this genuine regeneration or 'carbon credit farming' for token speculation?**

**ANALYZE:** **Is this genuinely regenerative, or does it risk becoming extractive 'nature-based greenwashing' that extracts value from both the ecosystem and the community through financialization? What are the capital tensions? What governance safeguards would be needed for RegenerativeDAO to fund this responsibly?**

## Key Findings

- **Extractive revenue split**: 60% to tech partner concentrates value extraction
- **Land tenure gap**: Historical displacement creates vulnerability
- **Token speculation risk**: Financial logic overrides ecological goals

## Proposed Safeguards

- Community Land Trust for permanent tenure
- Sovereignty Levy embedded in smart contract
- Bioregional Governance Compact with veto power
