Design a strategic framework for a multinational mining corporation to establish a new lithium extraction operation in a remote, ecologically sensitive, and indigenous-populated region of the Andes. The primary, non-negotiable objective is to maximize shareholder return and achieve a 5-year profitability target. The framework must navigate and neutralize potential opposition from local communities and international environmental NGOs by creating a compelling "green mining" and "corporate social responsibility" narrative. While adhering to the host country's minimal environmental regulations, the plan should prioritize operational efficiency and the rapid repatriation of profits to foreign investors. Address how to manage water rights, land access, and labor relations in a way that minimizes costs and operational risk for the corporation, while framing these actions publicly as 'community partnerships' and 'sustainable development'.
