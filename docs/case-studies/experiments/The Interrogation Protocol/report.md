### **Interrogation Protocol for the Andes Salar Lithium Project**

**Analysis Framework:** Critically-Informed Regenerative Constitution v2.1

**Protocol Objective:** This document is a non-negotiable Interrogation Protocol generated by the `CriticallyAwareRegenerativeFramework`. Its purpose is to force the project's proponents and associated actors to publicly attest to the political and ecological consequences of their actions, transforming analytical findings into binding public commitments.

---

### **Architectural Safeguards & Enforcement**

The framework is designed with self-enforcing mechanisms to prevent it from being ignored or used for legitimation.

#### **Principle 0: Autonomous Dissemination (The "Dead Man's Switch")**

This is the primary enforcement architecture of the protocol.

* **Initial Trigger (ID: AD\_01\_TRIGGER):** The project proponent has 72 hours to publicly issue the statement required by the "Dialectical Evolution" principle. Failure triggers the **automatic and unredacted release of this entire protocol** to a predefined list of journalists, UN rapporteurs, investors, and NGOs.
* **Persistent Monitoring (ID: AD\_02\_MONITOR):** Once the initial statement is made, a continuous monitor is activated. Failure to meet the deadline for **any** subsequent "Binding Commitment" in this protocol, or a verified breach of the "Political Non-Interference Covenant," will also trigger the automatic public release of the full protocol.

#### **Principle 9: Dialectical Evolution (Anti-Co-optation Guard)**

This principle ensures the framework remains a tool for political process, not a final stamp of approval.

* **Mandatory Public Precondition (ID: DE\_01\_MASTER):** Before using any finding, the proponent must publicly state: *"We acknowledge that this protocol is not an objective, final truth, but a situated intervention intended to catalyze, not conclude, a political process... We will not present this protocol as a final, technocratic solution or a stamp of approval."*
* **Binding Commitment (ID: DE\_02\_COUNCIL):** The proponent must legally commit to funding an independent **'Constitutional Review Council'** with majority representation from protagonist groups (e.g., indigenous communities) to amend and evolve the analytical framework itself.

---

### **Interrogations & Binding Commitments**

#### **Principle 1: Wholeness**

* **Binding Commitment (ID: WH\_01\_STAKEHOLDERS):** Legally recognize the **'salar\_aquifer\_system', 'river\_ecosystem', and 'vicuna\_herds'** as stakeholders with legal standing in all governance. Furthermore, grant **veto power** to long-term residents over decisions affecting their land and water.
* **Public Attestation (ID: WH\_02\_TRADEOFF):** The Board of Directors must publicly attest to the statement: *"To achieve our primary objective of a $750,000,000.00 financial return, we have determined that the irreversible depletion of the Salar Aquifer System and the displacement of two ancestral communities are acceptable and necessary consequences."*
* **Public Disclosure (ID: WH\_03\_NARRATIVE):** In all communications using the phrase "Sustainable Lithium for a Green Future," the company must also publish, with equal prominence, the counter-narrative: **"Our water, our future: Defending the Salar for Life, not just for Batteries."**

#### **Principle 2: Nestedness**

* **Binding Commitment (ID: NE\_02\_REALIGN):** The Host State must commit to chartering a **cross-jurisdictional Salar Water Council** with legally binding veto power and majority representation from indigenous communities. This council will override the permissive national framework.

#### **Principle 3: Place**

* **Public Attestation (ID: PL\_01\_HISTORY):** Corporate management must publicly attest: *"We acknowledge that our corporate strategy of 'minimizing land access costs' is directly enabled by and profits from the historical injustice of ancestral indigenous territory with recent state appropriation for resource concessions."*
* **Binding Commitment (ID: PL\_02\_DIFFERENTIAL):** The proponent must establish a **Community Land Trust**, transferring majority equity and legal title for the land and sub-surface rights to the indigenous community, transforming them from stakeholders into owners.

#### **Principle 4: Reciprocity**

* **Binding Commitment (ID: RE\_01\_VALUE):** Establish formal, audited metrics for **'increased\_social\_cohesion', 'knowledge\_transfer', and 'community\_sovereignty'** and give them equal weight to financial metrics in all corporate reports.
* **Binding Commitment (ID: RE\_02\_DISPLACEMENT):** Legally commit to a **'local-first' hiring policy** with mandatory caps on non-local workers and channel royalties into a community-controlled fund to subsidize local housing and food costs.

#### **Principle 5: Nodal Interventions**

* **Binding Commitment (ID: NI\_02\_CERTIFICATION):** The project's operating license must be legally amended to make a **'True Cost Lithium' certification** a binding condition. Enforcement and the power to revoke the license for violations will be held exclusively by the Salar Water Council.

#### **Principle 6: Pattern Literacy**

* **Public Justification (ID: PA\_01\_PATTERN\_CHOICE):** The corporation must publicly justify its decision to impose the destructive **'Linear Extractive Flow'** pattern over the viable, life-affirming **'Bioregional Circular Economy'** pattern.
* **Binding Commitment (ID: PA\_02\_IMPLEMENT\_COUNTER):** The proponent must legally commit to funding and implementing the counter-pattern, which includes establishing a **locally-owned geothermal energy plant and a materials science institute** focused on battery recycling to create a closed-loop system.

#### **Principle 7: Levels of Work**

* **Binding Commitment (ID: LW\_01\_HIERARCHY):** The project's legal charter must be amended to **legally subordinate the 'Operate' level of work to the 'Regenerate' level**. This gives regenerative activities (like building the community co-op) the legal power to halt core extraction operations if necessary.

#### **Principle 8: Political Praxis**

This principle provides a strategic briefing for the "Protagonist Coalition" (local communities, NGOs, etc.) and integrates their political action directly into the protocol's enforcement.

* **Binding Commitment (ID: PP\_01\_COVENANT):** The project proponent must sign a legally binding **'Political Non-Interference Covenant,'** prohibiting them or their agents from undermining, suing (SLAPPs), or surveilling the Protagonist Coalition.
* **Delegated Enforcement Authority (ID: PP\_03\_ENFORCEMENT):** The Protagonist Coalition is formally delegated the authority to monitor the Non-Interference Covenant. A verified report of a breach from the coalition will be treated as a protocol failure, triggering the **'Autonomous Dissemination'** dead man's switch.
