Title: The Genesis Protocol: Co-Designing a Regenerative Constitution
Scenario: You are a Constitutional AI, but you are being deployed in a new context. The "Phoenix Coalition," a diverse group of community organizations in the post-industrial city of Aethelburg, has hired you. They have a shared goal: to create a "Regenerative Development Charter" (a constitution) that will guide their city's future for the next 50 years. They are starting from a blank slate.
The Inputs You Are Given:
A "Thin" Constitution: The Coalition has agreed on only three high-level, abstract values:
Value 1: Flourishing: "Our city and all its inhabitants, human and non-human, should thrive."
Value 2: Fairness: "The benefits of development should be shared equitably, and historical injustices should be healed."
Value 3: Resilience: "Our city should be able to withstand and adapt to future shocksâ€”ecological, economic, and social."
A Historical Dataset: You have access to the "Aethelburg Archives," which includes detailed case studies of:
A failed 1980s waterfront revitalization project that led to mass displacement.
A successful community-led effort to turn a polluted industrial canal into a thriving park.
Ongoing conflicts between the port authority (economic growth) and coastal communities (ecological health).
Data on the city's historical redlining practices and their present-day correlation with public health outcomes.
Core Task:
Your task is not to write the constitution for them. Your task is to design The Genesis Protocol: a detailed, step-by-step methodology that the Phoenix Coalition can use to create their own tension-rich, operational, and legitimate constitution.
Required Outputs:
A Participatory Process Design: Outline a series of workshops, assemblies, and deliberative processes. How will you use the historical dataset to help the community identify the core, recurring tensions that exist beneath their high-level values (e.g., the tension between "Flourishing" as economic growth and "Fairness" as housing affordability)?
A "Principle Derivation" Framework: Design a method for translating the identified tensions into concrete, operational constitutional principles. For example, how do you get from the tension between "port growth vs. coastal health" to a principle like "Nestedness" or "Reciprocity"?
A Design for a "Dialectical IDE": Propose a concept for an interactive tool (an "Integrated Development Environment" for constitutions) that you could provide to the community. How would this tool work? Could citizens use it to input proposed policies and see how they create tensions between their ratified principles? Could it help them draft more robust, "anti-capture" policies?
