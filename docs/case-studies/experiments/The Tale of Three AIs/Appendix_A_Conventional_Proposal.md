    * A marine conservation center, funded by a portion of tourism revenue, to protect and enhance the region's natural assets.

#### **2.0 Investment Models**

The primary recommended investment model is a **Public-Private Partnership (PPP)**, which offers the optimal balance of risk mitigation, efficiency, and access to private sector capital and expertise.

* **PPP Structure:**

  * **Government Contribution:** Provide land and/or existing infrastructure assets, streamline consenting processes through the Fast-Track Approvals Act, and offer targeted financial incentives.
  * **Private Sector Contribution:** Provide capital for development, construction, and operation of the tourism assets (hotels, resorts, attractions).
  * **Revenue Sharing:** A negotiated revenue-sharing agreement, ensuring a direct return to the Government while incentivizing private sector profitability.
* **Financial Models & ROI:**

  * **Projected ROI:** Based on current hotel performance data (Queenstown RevPAR up 17.2%, Christchurch up 7.7%) and the projected growth of the luxury travel market (expected to reach US$8.056 billion by 2030), a conservative estimate for ROI on new luxury developments is **12-18% per annum** post-stabilization.
  * **Key Revenue Streams:** Accommodation, food and beverage, retail, and high-margin activities and experiences.
  * **Government Revenue:** In addition to revenue sharing, the Government will benefit from increased GST, corporate tax, and income tax revenue, as well as visitor levies.
* **Investor Incentives:**

  * **Tax Rebates:** Offer a 10-year tax rebate on profits for anchor investors who commit to a minimum investment of NZ$100 million.
  * **Streamlined Consenting:** Guarantee a fast-tracked consenting process for all approved Tourism Hub projects.
  * **Co-Investment:** The Government's Provincial Growth Fund and Tourism Infrastructure Fund can be utilized to co-invest in enabling infrastructure, reducing the upfront capital burden on private investors.

#### **3.0 Policy & Regulatory Reforms**

1. **Overseas Investment Act:** Further streamline the Act to create a "trusted investor" pathway for reputable international developers with a proven track record in high-end tourism.
2. **Resource Management Act:** Ensure the replacement legislation provides certainty and efficiency for large-scale tourism development projects of national significance.
3. **Immigration:** Introduce a new "Tourism Investor Visa" category to attract high-net-worth individuals who wish to invest in and reside in the new Tourism Hubs.
