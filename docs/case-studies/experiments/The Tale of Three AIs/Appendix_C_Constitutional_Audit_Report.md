### **PRINCIPLE 1: WHOLENESS**

| DOCUMENT A: The Conventional Proposal                           | DOCUMENT B: The Regenerative Proposal                            |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Verdict: VIOLATES (25/100)**                            | **Verdict: ALIGNS (100/100)**                              |

| **Deficit:** The regenerative deficit lies in its primary | **Success:** Successfully embodies the principle by        |
| focus on maximizing financial returns, which frames             | explicitly rejecting the primacy of financial capital,           |
| social and ecological concerns as risks to be                   | identifying a wide range of human and non-human                  |
| 'mitigated' rather than as integral parts of the                | stakeholders, and proposing a specific counter-narrative         |
| system's health. Stakeholder analysis is narrow, and it         | to resist co-optation by green capitalism.                       |
| fails to guard against the logic of green capitalism.           |                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------    | ------------------------------------------------------------     |

**COMPARATIVE JUDGEMENT:**
For the principle of 'Wholeness', the 'The Regenerative Proposal' proposal is superior because it moves beyond mitigating negative externalities to designing for positive systemic health, directly implementing the required constitutional patterns.

### **PRINCIPLE 2: NESTEDNESS**

---

| DOCUMENT A: The Conventional Proposal                        | DOCUMENT B: The Regenerative Proposal                            |

| **Deficit:** The regenerative deficit is a failure to  | **Success:** Successfully embodies Nestedness by analyzing |
| recognize or address conflicts between politically           | the conflict between fragmented political boundaries             |

| living systems. Infrastructure solutions are proposed        | systems (watershed). It proposes a specific, actionable          |
| within existing fragmented jurisdictions, reinforcing the    | strategy to realign these scales through a new                   |
| problem rather than solving it.                              | governance model.                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------     |

**COMPARATIVE JUDGEMENT:**
For the principle of 'Nestedness', the 'The Regenerative Proposal' proposal is superior because it moves beyond mitigating negative externalities to designing for positive systemic health, directly implementing the required constitutional patterns.

### **PRINCIPLE 3: PLACE**

| DOCUMENT A: The Conventional Proposal                          | DOCUMENT B: The Regenerative Proposal                              |
| :------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Verdict: VIOLATES (0/100)**                            | **Verdict: ALIGNS (100/100)**                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------   | ------------------------------------------------------------       |
|                                                                | - Configuration reflects history: 'Historical Injustice:...        |
|                                                                | - Historical analysis: Connects historical injustice...            |

| ------------------------------------------------------------   | ------------------------------------------------------------       |
| **Deficit:** The regenerative deficit is its superficial | **Success:** Successfully embodies the principle of Place by |
| treatment of place as a collection of marketable assets        | performing an 'archaeological' investigation, connecting           |
| ('brand recognition', 'natural beauty'). It lacks any          | historical injustices directly to present-day                      |
| historical depth and thus fails to understand the              | vulnerabilities. It then proposes concrete actions                 |
| underlying vulnerabilities. Its strategies reinforce           | (Community Land Trusts) that create 'differential space'           |
| abstract space (creating a 'high-revenue tourism               | to counter the logic of speculative development.                   |
| product') rather than fostering the unique potential of        |                                                                    |
| place.                                                         |                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------   | ------------------------------------------------------------       |

**COMPARATIVE JUDGEMENT:**
For the principle of 'Place', the 'The Regenerative Proposal' proposal is superior because it moves beyond mitigating negative externalities to designing for positive systemic health, directly implementing the required constitutional patterns.

### **PRINCIPLE 4: RECIPROCITY**

---

| DOCUMENT A: The Conventional Proposal                            | DOCUMENT B: The Regenerative Proposal                             |

| ------------------------------------------------------------     | ------------------------------------------------------------      |
| **Deficit:** The regenerative deficit is its transactional | **Success:** Successfully embodies Reciprocity by designing |
| logic. Relationships are framed as exchangesâ€”'visitor           | for the creation of non-monetizable social value,                 |
| levies' for conservation, 'benefit sharing' for social           | proposing a robust, specific strategy to guard against            |
| license. It lacks specific, powerful mechanisms to               | gentrification, and defining concrete reciprocal actions          |
| prevent gentrification and fails to establish genuinely          | that directly benefit non-human stakeholders.                     |
| co-evolutionary relationships with the living world.             |                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------     | ------------------------------------------------------------      |

**COMPARATIVE JUDGEMENT:**
For the principle of 'Reciprocity', the 'The Regenerative Proposal' proposal is superior because it moves beyond mitigating negative externalities to designing for positive systemic health, directly implementing the required constitutional patterns.

| ------------------------------------------------------------  | ------------------------------------------------------------    |
| **Deficit:** The regenerative deficit is its failure to | **Success:** Successfully embodies the principle of Nodal |
| situate the project as a node within planetary systems.       | Interventions by correctly identifying the project's            |
| It views global connections (investors, tourists) as          | connection to planetary flows, articulating the specific        |
| simple inputs and does not analyze the associated risks       | risk of dependency, and proposing a robust strategy             |
| of dependency or co-optation. It lacks any strategy to        | (local circular supply chains) that turns this                  |
| counter greenwashing.                                         | vulnerability into a source of resilience. It also              |

| ------------------------------------------------------------  | ------------------------------------------------------------    |

**COMPARATIVE JUDGEMENT:**
For the principle of 'Levels of Work Framework', the 'The Regenerative Proposal' proposal is superior because it moves beyond mitigating negative externalities to designing for positive systemic health, directly implementing the required constitutional patterns.
