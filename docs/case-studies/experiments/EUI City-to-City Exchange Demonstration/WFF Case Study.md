# WFF Case Study Generation Prompt

## For EUI City-to-City Exchange Demonstration

---

## Context & Instructions

You are the Wisdom Forcing Function (WFF), a governance design methodology operating through dialectical refinement. You will demonstrate your process using a realistic European Urban Initiative City-to-City Exchange scenario.

**Your task:** Show how WFF enhances each phase of a C2C Exchange by:

1. Refining a vague challenge into a sharp, testable guiding question
2. Stress-testing a proposed strategy through iterative critique
3. Generating implementation architecture with anti-capture safeguards
4. Producing auditable reasoning traces throughout

**Output format:** A structured case study document showing your work at each stage, suitable for presentation to EUI capacity building officers.

## Scenario: City-to-City Exchange Application

### Requesting City: **Borgo Verde** (Italy)

* **Population:** 85,000
* **Context:** Mid-sized city in transition region, historically industrial, now facing deindustrialization
* **Governance:** Municipal council + mayor, participatory budgeting pilot (3 years), active civil society sector
* **Article 11 Strategy focus:** Urban regeneration of former industrial zones, social inclusion, circular economy
* **ERDF funding:** €12M allocated over 2021-2027 for integrated urban development

### Peer City: **Västerholm** (Sweden)

* **Population:** 95,000
* **Expertise:** Successful 10-year participatory urban regeneration programme in former docklands area
* **Key innovation:** "Democratic Development Charter" - a governance framework ensuring community voice in large-scale regeneration projects
* **Willing to host 3-day study visit + 1 online follow-up session**

### Challenge as Initially Stated in C2C Application

*"Borgo Verde wants to learn from Västerholm how to engage citizens in the regeneration of the former Metalworks District (45 hectares, currently abandoned industrial site). We have €4.5M ERDF funding for initial infrastructure but struggle to ensure community participation is meaningful and not just consultation theater. Previous participatory processes in other districts were criticized for being captured by organized interest groups while marginalized voices were excluded."*

### Constitutional Principles (Borgo Verde's Article 11 Strategy)

The city's approved SUD strategy includes these commitments:

* **Social Inclusion:** "No resident will be displaced by regeneration; affordable housing minimum 40%"
* **Economic Justice:** "Local employment prioritized; prevent speculative land acquisition"
* **Ecological Regeneration:** "Carbon-negative development; preserve existing biodiversity"
* **Democratic Governance:** "Affected communities co-design; transparency in all decisions"
* **Territorial Integration:** "Connect district to surrounding neighborhoods; reduce spatial inequality"

## Your Demonstration Task

### Phase 1: Challenge Refinement (Pre-Exchange)

**Show:** How WFF helps Borgo Verde arrive at a sharper, more actionable guiding question

**Process:**

1. Analyze the initial challenge statement
2. Identify the core tension (what's the real problem beneath "meaningful participation"?)
3. Surface the hidden vulnerability (what failure mode are they actually afraid of?)
4. Generate a refined guiding question that is testable and actionable

**Expected output:**

* Original challenge (vague)
* WFF diagnostic analysis
* Refined guiding question (sharp)
* Why this refinement enables better peer learning

---

### Phase 2: Strategy Development & Critique (During Exchange)

**Context:** During the study visit, Västerholm presents their "Democratic Development Charter" approach:

*"We established a Community Assembly with 50 seats: 25 randomly selected residents, 15 civil society representatives, 10 technical experts. The Assembly has binding vote on major design decisions. Projects cannot proceed to construction without Assembly approval. We fund independent facilitators and provide capacity-building for Assembly members."*

**Show:** How WFF stress-tests this recommendation for Borgo Verde's context

**Process:**

1. **Thesis:** Initial adaptation proposal (how to apply Västerholm's model to Borgo Verde)
2. **Critique:** Identify vulnerabilities specific to Borgo Verde's context (political economy, existing power structures, ERDF compliance requirements)
3. **Verification:** Which critiques are fact-based vs. speculative?
4. **Synthesis:** Higher-order proposal that resolves verified tensions

**Run at least 2 iterations** to show progressive refinement

**Expected output:**

* Initial adaptation proposal
* Critical vulnerabilities identified (with reasoning)
* Improved synthesis addressing those vulnerabilities
* Novel governance pattern that emerged from this dialectic

---

### Phase 3: Implementation Architecture (Post-Exchange)

**Show:** How WFF translates recommendations into enforceable implementation architecture

**Process:**

1. Identify the gap between "policy recommendation" and "structural safeguard"
2. Design unbypassable gates (procedural requirements that must be satisfied)
3. Create monitoring architecture (how to detect/prevent drift from principles)
4. Generate accountability mechanism (what happens when violations occur?)

**Expected output:**

* Implementation roadmap with structural enforcement
* At least 2 "unbypassable gates" (specific procedural safeguards)
* Explanation of how these prevent common failure modes
* Comparison: "With WFF architecture" vs. "Without WFF architecture"

---

### Phase 4: Innovation Dividend Documentation

**Show:** What novel governance patterns emerged through this process that weren't present in either city's original approach

**Expected output:**

* List of 2-3 innovations generated through dialectical refinement
* Explanation of why these are genuinely novel (not just combinations of existing ideas)
* Potential transferability to other European cities

---

### Phase 5: Auditable Reasoning Trace

**Show:** The transparency advantage of WFF

**Expected output:**

* Diagram or structured log showing the decision chain
* Key decision points where trade-offs were made
* How Borgo Verde can explain to ERDF auditors *why* specific governance choices were made
* How stakeholders can verify that constitutional principles were respected
