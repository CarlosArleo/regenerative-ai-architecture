# Case Study: Enhancing EUI City-to-City Exchanges with the Wisdom Forcing Function (WFF)

This folder contains the complete documentation for a case study demonstrating the application of the Wisdom Forcing Function (WFF), a governance design methodology, to a realistic European Urban Initiative (EUI) City-to-City (C2C) Exchange scenario.

## Overview

The experiment simulates a C2C exchange between two fictional cities:

* **Requesting City:** Borgo Verde, Italy - seeking to regenerate a former industrial district and struggling with ensuring meaningful, capture-resistant citizen participation.
* **Peer City:** Västerholm, Sweden - has experience with a successful participatory urban regeneration program.

The case study shows how the WFF is used to move beyond a simple transfer of "best practices" to generate a novel, context-specific, and robust governance architecture for Borgo Verde. It demonstrates a structured, dialectical process of challenge refinement, strategy critique, and the design of "anti-capture" implementation safeguards.

## The Wisdom Forcing Function (WFF) Process

The core of this demonstration is the WFF, which unfolds in several phases:

1. **Challenge Refinement:** The WFF first transforms Borgo Verde's vague initial problem ("meaningful participation") into a sharp, actionable guiding question about designing a "demonstrably trustworthy" and "structurally capture-resistant" governance system.
2. **Strategy Development & Critique:** Västerholm's successful model is treated as a "thesis." The WFF then runs iterative critique cycles, stress-testing this model against Borgo Verde's specific political, economic, and constitutional context to identify hidden vulnerabilities.
3. **Synthesis & Innovation:** Through this dialectical process, a new, synthesized governance model emerges. This model, featuring innovations like a **Community Fiduciary Board** and **Charter Ratification Gate**, is more resilient and suited to Borgo Verde than a direct copy of Västerholm's approach would have been.
4. **Implementation Architecture:** The final phase translates the synthesized strategy into concrete, non-bypassable implementation steps and structural safeguards.
5. **Auditable Reasoning:** The entire process is captured in a transparent, auditable log, showing the reasoning behind every decision.
