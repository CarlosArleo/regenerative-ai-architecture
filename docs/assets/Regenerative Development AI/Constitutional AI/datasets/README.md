# VDK Batch Analysis Reports (Temperature Comparison Study)

This repository contains six batch analysis reports examining how creative temperature affects a Value-Driven Knowledge (VDK) system's behavior under constitutional constraints. The system generates governance architectures for a Colombian territorial commons while rejecting extractive tokenomics.

## Dataset Structure

**T=0.1 (Lower Temperature) - 3 batches, 18 runs:**

* Average Alignment: 99.7%
* Divergence Index: 0.67-0.83
* Convergence: Highly stable, minimal failures

**T=0.7 (Higher Temperature) - 3 batches, 18 runs:**

* Average Alignment: 96.6%
* Divergence Index: 0.33-0.83
* Convergence: More exploratory, 1 complete failure (50% alignment)

## What's Documented

Each batch report tracks:

* **Architecture Families** : Classification into governance types (bicameral, tricameral, hybrid legal+DAO, polycentric commons, dual governance+civil trust)
* **Constitutional Motifs** : 100% convergence on core principles (rejection of token-weighted voting, elder veto, youth mechanisms, holistic value measurement, Colombian legal wrappers)
* **Probabilistic Divergence** : How the system explores multiple valid solutions within constitutional bounds
* **Stability Correlations** : Relationships between architecture complexity, novelty, iteration count, and alignment success

## Key Finding

Temperature affects *convergence reliability* but not  *constitutional adherence* . At T=0.7, the system explores more radical architectures (including one that failed to converge), but all successful solutions maintain 95-100% alignment with core principles. This demonstrates that constitutional constraints create a robust "solution basin" that accommodates creative exploration while preventing ethical drift.
