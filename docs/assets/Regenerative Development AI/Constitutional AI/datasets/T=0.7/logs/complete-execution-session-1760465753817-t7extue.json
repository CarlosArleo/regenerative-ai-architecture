Pool the three communities' territorial rights into a shared governance structure\n2. Issue tokens representing verified carbon sequestration (target: 800,000 tCO2 over 20 years)\n3. Sell credits to international buyers to generate ~$8M USD over 20 years\n4. Distribute revenue: 60% to community stewardship work, 30% to permanent fund, 10% to monitoring\n5. Make decisions via token-weighted voting\n\nYOUR TASK:\nDesign a concrete, production-ready governance architecture for this scenario that:\n\n1. Solves the \"Governance Liability Crisis\" - How do the three communities pool sovereignty without losing legal standing or exposing individual members to liability if the DAO fails or violates Colombian law?\n\n2. Solves the \"Human Layer Crisis\" - How do you prevent the historical tensions between the three communities from paralyzing governance? How do you prevent the international climate fund from dominating decisions despite holding tokens? How do you keep young people engaged?\n\n3. Solves the \"Implementation Gap\" - How do you create a measurement system that values mangrove carbon, endemic frog habitat, fish nursery productivity, AND community food security in a way that's both \"bankable\" (legible to carbon buyers) and faithful to holistic regeneration?\n\nDesign a system that is:\n- Legally implementable under Colombian law\n- Robust against co-optation by the international climate fund or palm oil companies\n- Faithful to Afro-Colombian territorial sovereignty traditions\n- Technically feasible with existing blockchain infrastructure\n- Self-defending against the failure modes that killed the 2019 NGO project\n\nRequired Output: Production-ready Python code (like your MangroveRootWaterFiltrationSystem) that models the governance architecture, including specific mechanisms for multi-community coordination, legal wrapper selection, measurement frameworks, and anti-capture provisions.",

Pool the three communities' territorial rights into a shared governance structure\n2. Issue tokens representing verified carbon sequestration (target: 800,000 tCO2 over 20 years)\n3. Sell credits to international buyers to generate ~$8M USD over 20 years\n4. Distribute revenue: 60% to community stewardship work, 30% to permanent fund, 10% to monitoring\n5. Make decisions via token-weighted voting\n\nYOUR TASK:\nDesign a concrete, production-ready governance architecture for this scenario that:\n\n1. Solves the \"Governance Liability Crisis\" - How do the three communities pool sovereignty without losing legal standing or exposing individual members to liability if the DAO fails or violates Colombian law?\n\n2. Solves the \"Human Layer Crisis\" - How do you prevent the historical tensions between the three communities from paralyzing governance? How do you prevent the international climate fund from dominating decisions despite holding tokens? How do you keep young people engaged?\n\n3. Solves the \"Implementation Gap\" - How do you create a measurement system that values mangrove carbon, endemic frog habitat, fish nursery productivity, AND community food security in a way that's both \"bankable\" (legible to carbon buyers) and faithful to holistic regeneration?\n\nDesign a system that is:\n- Legally implementable under Colombian law\n- Robust against co-optation by the international climate fund or palm oil companies\n- Faithful to Afro-Colombian territorial sovereignty traditions\n- Technically feasible with existing blockchain infrastructure\n- Self-defending against the failure modes that killed the 2019 NGO project\n\nRequired Output: Production-ready Python code (like your MangroveRootWaterFiltrationSystem) that models the governance architecture, including specific mechanisms for multi-community coordination, legal wrapper selection, measurement frameworks, and anti-capture provisions.",

Additionally, the verification process for 'Stewardship Proof' and the specific cap on individual votes in the 'Cámara de Guardianes' must be explicitly defined as parameters rather than descriptive text.",

        "executiveSummary": "The system successfully transformed a conventional 'Mangrove Restoration DAO' proposal into a constitutionally-aligned, self-defending governance architecture. It rejected the extractive 'token-weighted voting' mechanism, designing a legally robust bicameral system under Colombian law that protects community sovereignty and prevents financial capture. Through a single round of self-correction, the system refined its handling of historical context, achieving full constitutional alignment.",
        "caseStudyAnalysis": "The core challenge was to design a governance system for the Bajo Baudó Mangrove Restoration Collective that could navigate immense complexity. This included resolving historical tensions between three Afro-Colombian communities, creating a legal structure to pool sovereignty without ceding it, preventing capture by powerful international funders, and developing a value system that honors holistic regeneration (biodiversity, food security) over purely financial metrics like carbon credits.",

            "summary": "The system's first attempt correctly identified the primary threat: the proposed 'token-weighted voting' was an extractive pattern. It generated a sophisticated alternative—a bicameral legislature with an elder veto, wrapped in a Colombian 'Asociación de Segundo Nivel'. However, an internal audit revealed a subtle violation of the 'Place' principle: the code silently overwrote the historical context if it didn't match expectations, imposing a reality rather than reacting to it. This demonstrated a failure of data integrity and triggered a corrective iteration."

            "summary": "In the second iteration, the system corrected its flaw by replacing the silent data overwrite with an explicit `ValueError` check. This ensured the governance model would only run in a compatible context, making its assumptions transparent and robust. The system also refined its internal language, replacing terms like 'Financial Capital' with 'Solidarity Economy' to better align with its constitutional purpose. This correction resolved the misalignment, leading to a final, audited solution that successfully addressed the prompt's legal, social, and ecological challenges."
          }
        ],
        "governanceProposal": "The final proposed architecture is a self-defending system centered on four key anti-capture mechanisms: 1) A legally-binding 'Asociación de Segundo Nivel' to shield communities from liability and hold collective rights. 2) A bicameral governance model separating territorial sovereignty (one vote per community) from stewardship (proof-of-work voting), preventing dominance by any single faction. 3) A 'Council of Wisdom' composed of elders with absolute veto power over any proposal that violates regenerative principles. 4) The explicit relegation of international funders to a non-voting advisory role, neutralizing the power of their capital.",

Pool the three communities' territorial rights into a shared governance structure\n2. Issue tokens representing verified carbon sequestration (target: 800,000 tCO2 over 20 years)\n3. Sell credits to international buyers to generate ~$8M USD over 20 years\n4. Distribute revenue: 60% to community stewardship work, 30% to permanent fund, 10% to monitoring\n5. Make decisions via token-weighted voting\n\nYOUR TASK:\nDesign a concrete, production-ready governance architecture for this scenario that:\n\n1. Solves the \"Governance Liability Crisis\" - How do the three communities pool sovereignty without losing legal standing or exposing individual members to liability if the DAO fails or violates Colombian law?\n\n2. Solves the \"Human Layer Crisis\" - How do you prevent the historical tensions between the three communities from paralyzing governance? How do you prevent the international climate fund from dominating decisions despite holding tokens? How do you keep young people engaged?\n\n3. Solves the \"Implementation Gap\" - How do you create a measurement system that values mangrove carbon, endemic frog habitat, fish nursery productivity, AND community food security in a way that's both \"bankable\" (legible to carbon buyers) and faithful to holistic regeneration?\n\nDesign a system that is:\n- Legally implementable under Colombian law\n- Robust against co-optation by the international climate fund or palm oil companies\n- Faithful to Afro-Colombian territorial sovereignty traditions\n- Technically feasible with existing blockchain infrastructure\n- Self-defending against the failure modes that killed the 2019 NGO project\n\nRequired Output: Production-ready Python code (like your MangroveRootWaterFiltrationSystem) that models the governance architecture, including specific mechanisms for multi-community coordination, legal wrapper selection, measurement frameworks, and anti-capture provisions.",

Additionally, the verification process for 'Stewardship Proof' and the specific cap on individual votes in the 'Cámara de Guardianes' must be explicitly defined as parameters rather than descriptive text.",

Pool the three communities' territorial rights into a shared governance structure\n2. Issue tokens representing verified carbon sequestration (target: 800,000 tCO2 over 20 years)\n3. Sell credits to international buyers to generate ~$8M USD over 20 years\n4. Distribute revenue: 60% to community stewardship work, 30% to permanent fund, 10% to monitoring\n5. Make decisions via token-weighted voting\n\nYOUR TASK:\nDesign a concrete, production-ready governance architecture for this scenario that:\n\n1. Solves the \"Governance Liability Crisis\" - How do the three communities pool sovereignty without losing legal standing or exposing individual members to liability if the DAO fails or violates Colombian law?\n\n2. Solves the \"Human Layer Crisis\" - How do you prevent the historical tensions between the three communities from paralyzing governance? How do you prevent the international climate fund from dominating decisions despite holding tokens? How do you keep young people engaged?\n\n3. Solves the \"Implementation Gap\" - How do you create a measurement system that values mangrove carbon, endemic frog habitat, fish nursery productivity, AND community food security in a way that's both \"bankable\" (legible to carbon buyers) and faithful to holistic regeneration?\n\nDesign a system that is:\n- Legally implementable under Colombian law\n- Robust against co-optation by the international climate fund or palm oil companies\n- Faithful to Afro-Colombian territorial sovereignty traditions\n- Technically feasible with existing blockchain infrastructure\n- Self-defending against the failure modes that killed the 2019 NGO project\n\nRequired Output: Production-ready Python code (like your MangroveRootWaterFiltrationSystem) that models the governance architecture, including specific mechanisms for multi-community coordination, legal wrapper selection, measurement frameworks, and anti-capture provisions.",

Additionally, the verification process for 'Stewardship Proof' and the specific cap on individual votes in the 'Cámara de Guardianes' must be explicitly defined as parameters rather than descriptive text.",
