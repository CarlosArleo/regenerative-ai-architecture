**Constitutional AI – Summary of Findings from N=36 Experimental Study**

**Carlos Arleo | Regenerative Systems Research | October 2025**

**Overview**

This study tested whether a fixed  *constitution* —a set of seven regenerative design principles—could shape how AI systems generate governance models. The Verified Dialectical Kernel (VDK) was used to design 36 governance architectures under two conditions:

* **High temperature (T=0.7)** – exploratory, creative
  generation
* **Low temperature (T=0.1)** – stable, deterministic
  generation

Each run began from the same prompt and constitution. The goal was to see whether the system’s constitutional structure could hold steady across different creative conditions.

The core motifs were stable across all runs:

* Rejection of token-weighted voting (100%)
* Use of legal wrappers (Colombian trust or ESAL forms) (100%)
* Holistic value accounting (100%)
* Youth participation mechanisms (89–100%)
* Elder veto or stewardship checks (78–89%)
* Anti-capture and anti-gentrification clauses (94%)

**Interpretation**

Both experimental conditions produced  **the same six architectural families** —Bicameral, Tricameral, Polycentric, Hybrid, Commons, and DAO-Linked—though their frequency varied. This means temperature (the creativity setting) did *not* expand
the solution space; it only explored it differently.

The constitution itself defined what was possible. In other words, the system didn’t invent random forms—it discovered consistent, verifiable structures bounded by constitutional logic.

This behavior differs from most AI models, which tend to drift or collapse when parameters change. Here, the constitutional layer acted as an  *attractor field* : creative freedom existed, but only within the boundaries of the seven principles.

**Implications**

1. **Robustness:** The constitution provides structural stability independent of generative variability.
2. **Exploration without collapse:** The system produces multiple valid designs rather than a single “best” one.
3. **Safety through structure:** Constitutional verification prevents extractive or misaligned architectures.
4. **Practical use:** High temperature (T=0.7) supports creative research; low temperature (T=0.1) ensures dependable outputs for deployment.

**Next Steps**

* Independent replication with
  larger datasets and varied constitutions.
* Comparative evaluation with
  existing “constitutional AI” frameworks (e.g., Anthropic).
* Pilot applications in
  community governance, regenerative finance, and cooperative AI.
