# VDK Batch Analysis Reports

This repository contains three batch analysis reports examining the behavior of a Value-Driven Knowledge (VDK) system under constitutional constraints. The system was tasked with generating governance architectures for a Colombian territorial commons, rejecting extractive tokenomics in favor of equitable, community-centered designs.

## What's Inside

Each batch analyzes 6 execution runs (18 total) at high creative temperature (T=0.1), documenting:

* **Probabilistic Divergence** : How the system explores multiple distinct architectural solutions (bicameral, tricameral, hybrid legal+DAO, polycentric commons) while maintaining alignment with core constitutional principles
* **Constitutional Convergence** : 100% consistency on non-negotiable motifs like rejection of token-weighted voting, elder/ancestral veto power, Colombian legal wrappers, youth mechanisms, and anti-gentrification guards
* **Architecture Families** : Classification of generated governance structures into 4-5 distinct families per batch
* **Stability Metrics** : Correlation analysis between architecture type, novelty, iteration count, and alignment success

## Key Finding

The VDK demonstrates **structured exploration** rather than deterministic outputâ€”it generates diverse, viable solutions within a constitutionally-defined "solution basin," proving that ethical constraints enhance rather than limit creative problem-solving.
