# VDK Batch Analysis Reports (T=0.1)

This repository contains three batch analysis reports examining the behavior of a Value-Driven Knowledge (VDK) system at low creative temperature (T=0.1). The system was tasked with generating governance architectures for a Colombian territorial commons, rejecting extractive tokenomics in favor of equitable, community-centered designs.

## What's Inside

Each batch analyzes 6 execution runs (18 total) at T=0.1, documenting:

* **Constrained Exploration** : How lower temperature enables reliable convergence while still exploring multiple distinct architectural solutions
* **Constitutional Convergence** : Near-perfect consistency (95-100%) on non-negotiable motifs across all runs (rejection of token-weighted voting, elder veto power, Colombian legal wrappers, youth mechanisms, holistic value measurement, anti-gentrification guards)
* **Architecture Families** : Classification into 4-5 distinct families per batch (tricameral council, polycentric commons, hybrid legal+DAO, bicameral veto, dual governance+civil trust, non-market trust)
* **High Reliability** : Analysis of convergence patterns showing minimal iteration variance and only one near-miss alignment (97%)

## Dataset Metrics

* **Total Runs** : 18 (across 3 batches)
* **Average Alignment** : 99.7%
* **Average Iterations** : 4.3
* **Divergence Index Range** : 0.67 - 0.83
* **Failed Convergence** : 0/18 (one 97% near-miss)

## Key Findings

**Lower Temperature = Reliable Convergence + Structured Diversity**

* The system consistently achieves 99-100% constitutional alignment while still generating 4-5 distinct architectural families per batch
* Zero complete failures, with only one run falling slightly short at 97% (Hybrid Legal+DAO architecture)
* Demonstrates that constitutional constraints don't require high temperature to produce diverse solutions—they naturally define a multi-stable solution space

**Convergence Patterns**

* Simplest architectures (polycentric commons) converge in 1-2 iterations
* Standard multi-chamber models (bicameral, tricameral) converge in 2-4 iterations
* Hybrid Legal+DAO architectures consistently require the most iterations (7-10) and show lower stability, suggesting this family represents a more complex constitutional challenge

**Architectural Diversity Despite Low Temperature**

* High Divergence Index (0.67-0.83) across all batches proves the system explores multiple valid solutions even at T=0.1
* All batches generate 4-5 unique governance families, indicating diversity emerges from constitutional logic rather than randomness
* Novel mechanisms still appear in every run, though they tend to be more incrementally refined than radical departures

**Motif Consistency**

* 100% frequency on most core motifs (token rejection, legal wrappers, elder veto, youth mechanisms, holistic value)
* Lower frequency on optional motifs like poison pills (17-33%) and formal conflict resolution (33-100%), showing the system distinguishes between essential and contextual requirements
* Batch 2 achieved 100% frequency on ALL tracked motifs, suggesting certain constitutional combinations create especially stable solution basins

**Stability Correlations**

* **Architecture Type** : Polycentric Commons = fastest convergence (1 iteration average); Hybrid Legal+DAO = slowest convergence (7-10 iterations, higher failure risk)
* **Novelty Complexity** : Detailed, technically-integrated novelties (e.g., "Sovereign Attestation Bridge," "Time-Weighted Proof of Stewardship Algorithm") require 2x more iterations than conceptual novelties (e.g., "Mangrove-Nursery Cycle Pattern")
* **Legal Wrapper Choice** : Civil Trusts (Fiducia Civil) associated with faster convergence and higher stability than standard non-profits (ESAL)

---

*This dataset demonstrates that low temperature produces highly reliable, constitutionally-aligned solutions while maintaining significant architectural diversity—proving that ethical constraints enhance rather than limit creative problem-solving through structured exploration of a multi-stable solution space.*
