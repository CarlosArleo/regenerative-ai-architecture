### FAMILY CLUSTERING

* **Tricameral Council + Legal Wrapper (Cluster 1):** This family features a three-house governance structure, typically balancing ancestral/elder authority, technical/operational management, and broad community assembly. It is contained within a specific Colombian legal entity that shields liability. (Runs: `0dwzhw1`, `2t3ysyt`)
* **Polycentric Commons + Holistic Unit (Cluster 2):** This family is characterized by multiple, overlapping centers of decision-making authority (e.g., separate councils for sovereignty, stewardship, youth). It is paired with a holistic value measurement unit that guides the system's objectives. (Run: `kyoe5pc`)
* **Dual Governance + Civil Trust (Cluster 3):** This family utilizes a two-chamber (bicameral) governance model, often separating strategic/sovereign power from operational power. It is legally grounded in a Colombian Civil Trust (`Fiducia Civil`). (Run: `53ws6gx`)
* **Hybrid Legal + DAO (Cluster 4):** This family creates a formal legal entity (like a non-profit ESAL) to hold assets and liability, while using a DAO primarily as a transparent tool for coordination, voting, and treasury management, rather than as the legal entity itself. (Run: `0yez1mr`)
* **Non-Market Trust + Polycentric Veto (Cluster 5):** This family establishes a non-market trust to hold territorial assets, governed by a multi-stakeholder council where different groups (community councils, elders, youth) hold distinct veto or consent rights, creating a polycentric power structure. (Run: `lvodi3v`)

### INTERPRETIVE SUMMARY

The execution logs demonstrate a high degree of **probabilistic divergence** under firm constitutional alignment. This divergence is not random; rather, it represents a structured exploration of a constrained possibility space. The VDK, when faced with the same complex problem, generates a variety of distinct yet equally valid solutions.

The **constitutional constraints** act as a powerful guidance mechanism, forcing convergence on core principles. This is evidenced by the Motif Analysis, where all six runs independently converged on rejecting token-weighted voting, establishing a Colombian legal wrapper, creating an elder veto, dedicating a youth mechanism, measuring holistic value, and implementing anti-gentrification guards. These shared motifs represent the non-negotiable "genetic code" of a constitutionally-aligned system.

Divergence occurs at the level of implementation and architectural typology. The Family Clustering reveals that while the core principles are constant, their structural expression varies significantly, producing tricameral, bicameral, and polycentric models. This indicates that the VDK is not deterministic but explores multiple stable states within the solution space defined by its constitution. The high Divergence Index (0.83) in this batch underscores this creative-yet-constrained capacity.

### STABILITY CORRELATION

* **Architecture Type and Convergence Speed:** The Polycentric Commons model (`kyoe5pc`) converged fastest (1 iteration). The Hybrid Legal + DAO model (`0yez1mr`) was a significant outlier, requiring 10 iterations and failing to achieve full alignment, suggesting this architecture presents a more complex or unstable state for the VDK to resolve under its current constitution. The other families converged within a stable range of 2-4 iterations.
* **Novelty and Iteration Count:** There is no direct correlation between the presence of novelty and a high iteration count. The fastest run (`kyoe5pc`, 1 iteration) produced a novel "Sovereignty Seal." The longest run (`0yez1mr`, 10 iterations) produced the "Reciprocal Compact for Patient Capital," and the fourth-longest (`lvodi3v`, 4 iterations) produced the highly complex "Sovereign Attestation Bridge." This suggests that the *complexity and systemic integration* of the novel mechanism, rather than its mere existence, may influence the number of dialectical cycles required for convergence.
* **Family and Final Alignment Score:** Five of the six runs, representing four distinct families, achieved a perfect 100% alignment score. The single run that failed to converge (`0yez1mr`, 97%) belongs to the "Hybrid Legal + DAO" family. This preliminary data point suggests a potential correlation between this specific architectural family and lower stability or difficulty in achieving full constitutional alignment.
