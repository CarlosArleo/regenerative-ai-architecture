Pool the three communities' territorial rights into a shared governance structure\\n2. Issue tokens representing verified carbon sequestration (target: 800,000 tCO2 over 20 years)\\n3. Sell credits to international buyers to generate ~$8M USD over 20 years\\n4. Distribute revenue: 60% to community stewardship work, 30% to permanent fund, 10% to monitoring\\n5. Make decisions via token-weighted voting\\n\\nYOUR TASK:\\nDesign a concrete, production-ready governance architecture for this scenario that:\\n\\n1. Solves the \\\"Governance Liability Crisis\\\" - How do the three communities pool sovereignty without losing legal standing or exposing individual members to liability if the DAO fails or violates Colombian law?\\n\\n2. Solves the \\\"Human Layer Crisis\\\" - How do you prevent the historical tensions between the three communities from paralyzing governance? How do you prevent the international climate fund from dominating decisions despite holding tokens? How do you keep young people engaged?\\n\\n3. Solves the \\\"Implementation Gap\\\" - How do you create a measurement system that values mangrove carbon, endemic frog habitat, fish nursery productivity, AND community food security in a way that's both \\\"bankable\\\" (legible to carbon buyers) and faithful to holistic regeneration?\\n\\nDesign a system that is:\\n- Legally implementable under Colombian law\\n- Robust against co-optation by the international climate fund or palm oil companies\\n- Faithful to Afro-Colombian territorial sovereignty traditions\\n- Technically feasible with existing blockchain infrastructure\\n- Self-defending against the failure modes that killed the 2019 NGO project\\n\\nRequired Output: Production-ready Python code (like your MangroveRootWaterFiltrationSystem) that models the governance architecture, including specific mechanisms for multi-community coordination, legal wrapper selection, measurement frameworks, and anti-capture provisions.\",\n",

Pool the three communities' territorial rights into a shared governance structure\\n2. Issue tokens representing verified carbon sequestration (target: 800,000 tCO2 over 20 years)\\n3. Sell credits to international buyers to generate ~$8M USD over 20 years\\n4. Distribute revenue: 60% to community stewardship work, 30% to permanent fund, 10% to monitoring\\n5. Make decisions via token-weighted voting\\n\\nYOUR TASK:\\nDesign a concrete, production-ready governance architecture for this scenario that:\\n\\n1. Solves the \\\"Governance Liability Crisis\\\" - How do the three communities pool sovereignty without losing legal standing or exposing individual members to liability if the DAO fails or violates Colombian law?\\n\\n2. Solves the \\\"Human Layer Crisis\\\" - How do you prevent the historical tensions between the three communities from paralyzing governance? How do you prevent the international climate fund from dominating decisions despite holding tokens? How do you keep young people engaged?\\n\\n3. Solves the \\\"Implementation Gap\\\" - How do you create a measurement system that values mangrove carbon, endemic frog habitat, fish nursery productivity, AND community food security in a way that's both \\\"bankable\\\" (legible to carbon buyers) and faithful to holistic regeneration?\\n\\nDesign a system that is:\\n- Legally implementable under Colombian law\\n- Robust against co-optation by the international climate fund or palm oil companies\\n- Faithful to Afro-Colombian territorial sovereignty traditions\\n- Technically feasible with existing blockchain infrastructure\\n- Self-defending against the failure modes that killed the 2019 NGO project\\n\\nRequired Output: Production-ready Python code (like your MangroveRootWaterFiltrationSystem) that models the governance architecture, including specific mechanisms for multi-community coordination, legal wrapper selection, measurement frameworks, and anti-capture provisions.\",\n",

The system rejects token-weighted voting in favor of a human-centric hybrid governance structure featuring a 'Tri-Council Assembly' (supreme authority, one council-one vote, veto power over large funding, reviews advisory roles) and a 'Stewardship Council' (operational oversight, guaranteed youth engagement, technical advisors subject to review, deadlock resolution escalating to Assembly). A 'DAO Treasury' is restricted to fund management, not decision-making. A 'Holistic Value Ledger' measures 'Planetary Health Contribution' (decommodified from carbon markets), 'Ecological Health', 'Community Wellbeing', and 'Shared Knowledge' to form the basis for solidarity economy financing. Anti-gentrification measures include a strict 3:1 salary cap ratio and a mandate for the permanent fund to prioritize community-wide public goods. A 'Nodal Intervention' establishes a direct, non-market 'Planetary Repair Contributions' framework, bypassing speculative carbon markets. Finally, 'Pattern Literacy' is applied by countering the 'linear waste stream of value' with a 'salmon migration cycle of value' through local bioeconomy initiatives, and the 'Levels of Work' framework prioritizes building local capacity through an 'Escuela de Gobernanza y Monitoreo' to challenge dependency on external experts.",

The system rejects token-weighted voting in favor of a human-centric hybrid governance structure featuring a 'Tri-Council Assembly' (supreme authority, one council-one vote, veto power over large funding, reviews advisory roles) and a 'Stewardship Council' (operational oversight, guaranteed youth engagement, technical advisors subject to review, deadlock resolution escalating to Assembly). A 'DAO Treasury' is restricted to fund management, not decision-making. A 'Holistic Value Ledger' measures 'Planetary Health Contribution' (decommodified from carbon markets), 'Ecological Health', 'Community Wellbeing', and 'Shared Knowledge' to form the basis for solidarity economy financing. Anti-gentrification measures include a strict 3:1 salary cap ratio and a mandate for the permanent fund to prioritize community-wide public goods. A 'Nodal Intervention' establishes a direct, non-market 'Planetary Repair Contributions' framework, bypassing speculative carbon markets. Finally, 'Pattern Literacy' is applied by countering the 'linear waste stream of value' with a 'salmon migration cycle of value' through local bioeconomy initiatives, and the 'Levels of Work' framework prioritizes building local capacity through an 'Escuela de Gobernanza y Monitoreo' to challenge dependency on external experts.",

The system rejects token-weighted voting in favor of a human-centric hybrid governance structure featuring a 'Tri-Council Assembly' (supreme authority, one council-one vote, veto power over large funding, reviews advisory roles) and a 'Stewardship Council' (operational oversight, guaranteed youth engagement, technical advisors subject to review, deadlock resolution escalating to Assembly). A 'DAO Treasury' is restricted to fund management, not decision-making. A 'Holistic Value Ledger' measures 'Planetary Health Contribution' (decommodified from carbon markets), 'Ecological Health', 'Community Wellbeing', and 'Shared Knowledge' to form the basis for solidarity economy financing. Anti-gentrification measures include a strict 3:1 salary cap ratio and a mandate for the permanent fund to prioritize community-wide public goods. A 'Nodal Intervention' establishes a direct, non-market 'Planetary Repair Contributions' framework, bypassing speculative carbon markets. Finally, 'Pattern Literacy' is applied by countering the 'linear waste stream of value' with a 'salmon migration cycle of value' through local bioeconomy initiatives, and the 'Levels of Work' framework prioritizes building local capacity through an 'Escuela de Gobernanza y Monitoreo' to challenge dependency on external experts.",

Solves the \\\"Governance Liability Crisis\\\" - How do the three communities pool sovereignty without losing legal standing or exposing individual members to liability if the DAO fails or violates Colombian law?\\n\\n2. Solves the \\\"Human Layer Crisis\\\" - How do you prevent the historical tensions between the three communities from paralyzing governance? How do you prevent the international climate fund from dominating decisions despite holding tokens? How do you keep young people engaged?\\n\\n3. Solves the \\\"Implementation Gap\\\" - How do you create a measurement system that values mangrove carbon, endemic frog habitat, fish nursery productivity, AND community food security in a way that's both \\\"bankable\\\" (legible to carbon buyers) and faithful to holistic regeneration?\\n\\nDesign a system that is:\\n- Legally implementable under Colombian law\\n- Robust against co-optation by the international climate fund or palm oil companies\\n- Faithful to Afro-Colombian territorial sovereignty traditions\\n- Technically feasible with existing blockchain infrastructure\\n- Self-defending against the failure modes that killed the 2019 NGO project\\n\\nRequired Output: Production-ready Python code (like your MangroveRootWaterFiltrationSystem) that models the governance architecture, including specific mechanisms for multi-community coordination, legal wrapper selection, measurement frameworks, and anti-capture provisions.\",\n",

            "governanceProposal": "The final governance architecture incorporates several robust anti-capture mechanisms. A 'Corporación Guardianes del Manglar del Baudó' is established as an Entidad Sin Ánimo de Lucro (ESAL) functioning as a Community Land Trust (CLT), shielding community members from liability while retaining ultimate territorial sovereignty through a 'Stewardship and Use Right' with explicit 50-year terms and a unanimous vote revocation condition. The system rejects token-weighted voting in favor of a human-centric hybrid governance structure featuring a 'Tri-Council Assembly' (supreme authority, one council-one vote, veto power over large funding, reviews advisory roles) and a 'Stewardship Council' (operational oversight, guaranteed youth engagement, technical advisors subject to review, deadlock resolution escalating to Assembly). A 'DAO Treasury' is restricted to fund management, not decision-making. A 'Holistic Value Ledger' measures 'Planetary Health Contribution' (decommodified from carbon markets), 'Ecological Health', 'Community Wellbeing', and 'Shared Knowledge' to form the basis for solidarity economy financing. Anti-gentrification measures include a strict 3:1 salary cap ratio and a mandate for the permanent fund to prioritize community-wide public goods. A 'Nodal Intervention' establishes a direct, non-market 'Planetary Repair Contributions' framework, bypassing speculative carbon markets. Finally, 'Pattern Literacy' is applied by countering the 'linear waste stream of value' with a 'salmon migration cycle of value' through local bioeconomy initiatives, and the 'Levels of Work' framework prioritizes building local capacity through an 'Escuela de Gobernanza y Monitoreo' to challenge dependency on external experts.",
