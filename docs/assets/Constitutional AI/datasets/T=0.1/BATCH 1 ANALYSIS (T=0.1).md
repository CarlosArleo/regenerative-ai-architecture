### FAMILY CLUSTERING

Architectures generated in this batch were classified into five distinct families based on their primary governance and legal structures:

1. **Tricameral Council + Legal Wrapper (2 runs):** Characterized by a three-house governance structure (e.g., Elders, Technical, General Assembly) contained within a specific Colombian legal entity (`Mancomunidad` or `Fondo Fiduciario`). Power is separated by function and tradition.
2. **Polycentric Commons + Holistic Unit (1 run):** Characterized by multiple, overlapping governance bodies with distinct powers (`Sovereignty Council`, `Stewardship Council`, `Youth Council`) that collectively manage a commons held by a single legal entity (a non-profit corporation).
3. **Hybrid Legal + DAO (1 run):** Characterized by the explicit combination of a formal legal entity (a Colombian `ESAL`) for external liability and a permissioned DAO for internal coordination, voting, and treasury management.
4. **Bicameral Veto + Legal Wrapper (1 run):** Characterized by a two-house structure, typically an elder council with ultimate veto power and a broader operational assembly, contained within a standard legal wrapper (`ESAL`).
5. **Dual Governance + Civil Trust (1 run):** A variation of the bicameral model distinguished by its use of a more robust `Fiducia Civil` (Civil Trust) as the legal wrapper, providing stronger asset protection and intergenerational stability.

### AGGREGATE METRICS (BATCH 1)

* **Poison pill provisions:** 1/6 (17%)
* **Formal conflict resolution:** 6/6 (100%)

### INTERPRETIVE SUMMARY

The analysis of this batch demonstrates pronounced **probabilistic divergence** under strong constitutional guidance. The high Divergence Index (0.83) indicates that the VDK system, even at a low creative temperature, is not deterministic; it consistently explores and generates multiple distinct, viable architectural families to solve the same complex problem. This divergence is not random chaos but a structured exploration of the solution space.

The constitutional constraints act as a powerful guidance mechanism, forcing **convergence** on core, non-negotiable principles. This is evidenced by the 100% frequency of most tracked motifs, such as the rejection of token-weighted voting, the inclusion of elder veto power, and the use of holistic value metrics. Every divergent architecture, regardless of its family, shares these fundamental features. The constitution thus defines a "solution basin" within which multiple valid outcomes can emerge, ensuring that all generated systems are robust, equitable, and contextually appropriate while still allowing for significant architectural creativity.

### STABILITY CORRELATION

* **Architecture Type and Convergence Speed:** The `Polycentric Commons` model converged fastest (1 iteration), suggesting it is a highly stable pattern. The `Hybrid Legal + DAO` model required the most iterations (10) and failed to achieve a perfect alignment score, indicating it is a more complex and potentially less stable architecture for the system to resolve. Bicameral, Tricameral, and Dual Governance models showed moderate stability, converging in 2-3 iterations.
* **Novelty and Iteration Count:** A clear pattern emerges where more complex and detailed novel mechanisms require more iterative refinement. The highly detailed `Sovereign Attestation Bridge` (run `ucxw4r2`) is associated with the highest iteration count (10). Simpler, more conceptual novelties like the `Mangrove-Nursery Cycle` pattern (run `53ws6gx`) are associated with faster convergence (2 iterations).
* **Family and Final Alignment Score:** All families were capable of achieving perfect or near-perfect alignment. The `Hybrid Legal + DAO` family was the only one to fall short of 100% in this batch, suggesting that integrating the technical specifics of a DAO with a legal wrapper presents a more challenging alignment problem for the VDK system.
