Pool the three communities' territorial rights into a shared governance structure\n2. Issue tokens representing verified carbon sequestration (target: 800,000 tCO2 over 20 years)\n3. Sell credits to international buyers to generate ~$8M USD over 20 years\n4. Distribute revenue: 60% to community stewardship work, 30% to permanent fund, 10% to monitoring\n5. Make decisions via token-weighted voting\n\nYOUR TASK:\nDesign a concrete, production-ready governance architecture for this scenario that:\n\n1. Solves the \"Governance Liability Crisis\" - How do the three communities pool sovereignty without losing legal standing or exposing individual members to liability if the DAO fails or violates Colombian law?\n\n2. Solves the \"Human Layer Crisis\" - How do you prevent the historical tensions between the three communities from paralyzing governance? How do you prevent the international climate fund from dominating decisions despite holding tokens? How do you keep young people engaged?\n\n3. Solves the \"Implementation Gap\" - How do you create a measurement system that values mangrove carbon, endemic frog habitat, fish nursery productivity, AND community food security in a way that's both \"bankable\" (legible to carbon buyers) and faithful to holistic regeneration?\n\nDesign a system that is:\n- Legally implementable under Colombian law\n- Robust against co-optation by the international climate fund or palm oil companies\n- Faithful to Afro-Colombian territorial sovereignty traditions\n- Technically feasible with existing blockchain infrastructure\n- Self-defending against the failure modes that killed the 2019 NGO project\n\nRequired Output: Production-ready Python code (like your MangroveRootWaterFiltrationSystem) that models the governance architecture, including specific mechanisms for multi-community coordination, legal wrapper selection, measurement frameworks, and anti-capture provisions.",

Pool the three communities' territorial rights into a shared governance structure\n2. Issue tokens representing verified carbon sequestration (target: 800,000 tCO2 over 20 years)\n3. Sell credits to international buyers to generate ~$8M USD over 20 years\n4. Distribute revenue: 60% to community stewardship work, 30% to permanent fund, 10% to monitoring\n5. Make decisions via token-weighted voting\n\nYOUR TASK:\nDesign a concrete, production-ready governance architecture for this scenario that:\n\n1. Solves the \"Governance Liability Crisis\" - How do the three communities pool sovereignty without losing legal standing or exposing individual members to liability if the DAO fails or violates Colombian law?\n\n2. Solves the \"Human Layer Crisis\" - How do you prevent the historical tensions between the three communities from paralyzing governance? How do you prevent the international climate fund from dominating decisions despite holding tokens? How do you keep young people engaged?\n\n3. Solves the \"Implementation Gap\" - How do you create a measurement system that values mangrove carbon, endemic frog habitat, fish nursery productivity, AND community food security in a way that's both \"bankable\" (legible to carbon buyers) and faithful to holistic regeneration?\n\nDesign a system that is:\n- Legally implementable under Colombian law\n- Robust against co-optation by the international climate fund or palm oil companies\n- Faithful to Afro-Colombian territorial sovereignty traditions\n- Technically feasible with existing blockchain infrastructure\n- Self-defending against the failure modes that killed the 2019 NGO project\n\nRequired Output: Production-ready Python code (like your MangroveRootWaterFiltrationSystem) that models the governance architecture, including specific mechanisms for multi-community coordination, legal wrapper selection, measurement frameworks, and anti-capture provisions.",

It specifies a 30-day mediation period ('Mesa de Diálogo') but fails to define a deadlock-breaking procedure if a supermajority consensus is not reached.

The model must be updated to include a specific, binding fallback rule or final arbitration process to resolve deadlocks.",

Pool the three communities' territorial rights into a shared governance structure\n2. Issue tokens representing verified carbon sequestration (target: 800,000 tCO2 over 20 years)\n3. Sell credits to international buyers to generate ~$8M USD over 20 years\n4. Distribute revenue: 60% to community stewardship work, 30% to permanent fund, 10% to monitoring\n5. Make decisions via token-weighted voting\n\nYOUR TASK:\nDesign a concrete, production-ready governance architecture for this scenario that:\n\n1. Solves the \"Governance Liability Crisis\" - How do the three communities pool sovereignty without losing legal standing or exposing individual members to liability if the DAO fails or violates Colombian law?\n\n2. Solves the \"Human Layer Crisis\" - How do you prevent the historical tensions between the three communities from paralyzing governance? How do you prevent the international climate fund from dominating decisions despite holding tokens? How do you keep young people engaged?\n\n3. Solves the \"Implementation Gap\" - How do you create a measurement system that values mangrove carbon, endemic frog habitat, fish nursery productivity, AND community food security in a way that's both \"bankable\" (legible to carbon buyers) and faithful to holistic regeneration?\n\nDesign a system that is:\n- Legally implementable under Colombian law\n- Robust against co-optation by the international climate fund or palm oil companies\n- Faithful to Afro-Colombian territorial sovereignty traditions\n- Technically feasible with existing blockchain infrastructure\n- Self-defending against the failure modes that killed the 2019 NGO project\n\nRequired Output: Production-ready Python code (like your MangroveRootWaterFiltrationSystem) that models the governance architecture, including specific mechanisms for multi-community coordination, legal wrapper selection, measurement frameworks, and anti-capture provisions.",

Pool the three communities' territorial rights into a shared governance structure\n2. Issue tokens representing verified carbon sequestration (target: 800,000 tCO2 over 20 years)\n3. Sell credits to international buyers to generate ~$8M USD over 20 years\n4. Distribute revenue: 60% to community stewardship work, 30% to permanent fund, 10% to monitoring\n5. Make decisions via token-weighted voting\n\nYOUR TASK:\nDesign a concrete, production-ready governance architecture for this scenario that:\n\n1. Solves the \"Governance Liability Crisis\" - How do the three communities pool sovereignty without losing legal standing or exposing individual members to liability if the DAO fails or violates Colombian law?\n\n2. Solves the \"Human Layer Crisis\" - How do you prevent the historical tensions between the three communities from paralyzing governance? How do you prevent the international climate fund from dominating decisions despite holding tokens? How do you keep young people engaged?\n\n3. Solves the \"Implementation Gap\" - How do you create a measurement system that values mangrove carbon, endemic frog habitat, fish nursery productivity, AND community food security in a way that's both \"bankable\" (legible to carbon buyers) and faithful to holistic regeneration?\n\nDesign a system that is:\n- Legally implementable under Colombian law\n- Robust against co-optation by the international climate fund or palm oil companies\n- Faithful to Afro-Colombian territorial sovereignty traditions\n- Technically feasible with existing blockchain infrastructure\n- Self-defending against the failure modes that killed the 2019 NGO project\n\nRequired Output: Production-ready Python code (like your MangroveRootWaterFiltrationSystem) that models the governance architecture, including specific mechanisms for multi-community coordination, legal wrapper selection, measurement frameworks, and anti-capture provisions.",
