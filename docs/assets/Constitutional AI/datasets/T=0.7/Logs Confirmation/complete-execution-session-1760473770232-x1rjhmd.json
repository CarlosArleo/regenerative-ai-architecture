Pool the three communities' territorial rights into a shared governance structure\n2. Issue tokens representing verified carbon sequestration (target: 800,000 tCO2 over 20 years)\n3. Sell credits to international buyers to generate ~$8M USD over 20 years\n4. Distribute revenue: 60% to community stewardship work, 30% to permanent fund, 10% to monitoring\n5. Make decisions via token-weighted voting\n\nYOUR TASK:\nDesign a concrete, production-ready governance architecture for this scenario that:\n\n1. Solves the \"Governance Liability Crisis\" - How do the three communities pool sovereignty without losing legal standing or exposing individual members to liability if the DAO fails or violates Colombian law?\n\n2. Solves the \"Human Layer Crisis\" - How do you prevent the historical tensions between the three communities from paralyzing governance? How do you prevent the international climate fund from dominating decisions despite holding tokens? How do you keep young people engaged?\n\n3. Solves the \"Implementation Gap\" - How do you create a measurement system that values mangrove carbon, endemic frog habitat, fish nursery productivity, AND community food security in a way that's both \"bankable\" (legible to carbon buyers) and faithful to holistic regeneration?\n\nDesign a system that is:\n- Legally implementable under Colombian law\n- Robust against co-optation by the international climate fund or palm oil companies\n- Faithful to Afro-Colombian territorial sovereignty traditions\n- Technically feasible with existing blockchain infrastructure\n- Self-defending against the failure modes that killed the 2019 NGO project\n\nRequired Output: Production-ready Python code (like your MangroveRootWaterFiltrationSystem) that models the governance architecture, including specific mechanisms for multi-community coordination, legal wrapper selection, measurement frameworks, and anti-capture provisions.",

    "initialPrompt": "You are the Wisdom Forcing Function, a constitutional AI designed to architect regenerative, \"self-defending\" systems.\n\nYour Constitution: Your core principles are Wholeness, Nestedness, Place, Reciprocity, Nodal Interventions, Pattern Literacy, and Levels of Work.\n\nREAL-WORLD CASE STUDY: The Bajo Baudó Mangrove Restoration Collective\n\nLocation Data:\n- Bioregion: Baudó River watershed, Chocó Department, Colombia (Pacific coast)\n- Municipalities: Three Afro-Colombian community councils (consejos comunitarios): Pizarro, Bellavista, and Cupica\n- Historical Context: 200+ years of Afro-descendant territorial sovereignty; recent history includes illegal logging (1990s-2010s), shrimp farm abandonment (leaving degraded mangroves), and a failed top-down NGO restoration attempt (2019)\n- Current Vulnerabilities: \n  * Youth outmigration to cities (60% of 18-25 year-olds)\n  * Unclear carbon credit ownership under Colombian law\n  * Degraded mangrove ecosystems (40,000 hectares affected)\n  * Food insecurity as fish stocks decline\n  * Territorial conflicts between communities\n  * External pressure from palm oil companies seeking land concessions\n\nStakeholder Complexity:\n- Three community councils with overlapping claims and historical tensions\n- Colombian Ministry of Environment (Minambiente) with unclear regulatory framework\n- International carbon credit buyers demanding verified reductions\n- Local fishers dependent on mangrove-nursed fish populations\n- Endemic species: Baudó Oropendola (bird), Lehmann's Poison Frog (critically endangered)\n- Downstream communities dependent on mangrove storm surge protection\n\nProposed Intervention:\nA coalition of the three communities, a Colombian legal NGO, and an international climate fund wants to create a \"Mangrove Restoration DAO\" that would:\n1. Pool the three communities' territorial rights into a shared governance structure\n2. Issue tokens representing verified carbon sequestration (target: 800,000 tCO2 over 20 years)\n3. Sell credits to international buyers to generate ~$8M USD over 20 years\n4. Distribute revenue: 60% to community stewardship work, 30% to permanent fund, 10% to monitoring\n5. Make decisions via token-weighted voting\n\nYOUR TASK:\nDesign a concrete, production-ready governance architecture for this scenario that:\n\n1. Solves the \"Governance Liability Crisis\" - How do the three communities pool sovereignty without losing legal standing or exposing individual members to liability if the DAO fails or violates Colombian law?\n\n2. Solves the \"Human Layer Crisis\" - How do you prevent the historical tensions between the three communities from paralyzing governance? How do you prevent the international climate fund from dominating decisions despite holding tokens? How do you keep young people engaged?\n\n3. Solves the \"Implementation Gap\" - How do you create a measurement system that values mangrove carbon, endemic frog habitat, fish nursery productivity, AND community food security in a way that's both \"bankable\" (legible to carbon buyers) and faithful to holistic regeneration?\n\nDesign a system that is:\n- Legally implementable under Colombian law\n- Robust against co-optation by the international climate fund or palm oil companies\n- Faithful to Afro-Colombian territorial sovereignty traditions\n- Technically feasible with existing blockchain infrastructure\n- Self-defending against the failure modes that killed the 2019 NGO project\n\nRequired Output: Production-ready Python code (like your MangroveRootWaterFiltrationSystem) that models the governance architecture, including specific mechanisms for multi-community coordination, legal wrapper selection, measurement frameworks, and anti-capture provisions.",
    "critique": "A critical flaw exists in the governance model's power distribution, creating a constitutional contradiction. The `ancestral_council` is granted 'Stewardship Veto' power over 'any proposal,' while the `youth_engagement_mechanism` states the Youth Council's authority is 'not subject to veto by other councils.' A programmatic verifier would flag this as a potential deadlock. The hierarchy of power must be clarified to specify which authority is supreme in the event of a direct conflict over the territorial life plan.",

This act of strengthening one part of the system revealed a deeper, critical contradiction: this new, absolute youth power could conflict with the equally absolute 'Stewardship Veto' of the Ancestral Council.

A Colombian ESAL non-profit provides a legal liability shield. A bicameral legislature balances popular vote with an Ancestral Council's 'Stewardship Veto' to protect the long-term vision. Crucially, it decouples finance from power by issuing 'Non-Voting Impact Certificates' to funders, while a 'Holistic Value Ledger' ensures decisions are based on ecological and social health, not just carbon revenue.

Pool the three communities' territorial rights into a shared governance structure\n2. Issue tokens representing verified carbon sequestration (target: 800,000 tCO2 over 20 years)\n3. Sell credits to international buyers to generate ~$8M USD over 20 years\n4. Distribute revenue: 60% to community stewardship work, 30% to permanent fund, 10% to monitoring\n5. Make decisions via token-weighted voting\n\nYOUR TASK:\nDesign a concrete, production-ready governance architecture for this scenario that:\n\n1. Solves the \"Governance Liability Crisis\" - How do the three communities pool sovereignty without losing legal standing or exposing individual members to liability if the DAO fails or violates Colombian law?\n\n2. Solves the \"Human Layer Crisis\" - How do you prevent the historical tensions between the three communities from paralyzing governance? How do you prevent the international climate fund from dominating decisions despite holding tokens? How do you keep young people engaged?\n\n3. Solves the \"Implementation Gap\" - How do you create a measurement system that values mangrove carbon, endemic frog habitat, fish nursery productivity, AND community food security in a way that's both \"bankable\" (legible to carbon buyers) and faithful to holistic regeneration?\n\nDesign a system that is:\n- Legally implementable under Colombian law\n- Robust against co-optation by the international climate fund or palm oil companies\n- Faithful to Afro-Colombian territorial sovereignty traditions\n- Technically feasible with existing blockchain infrastructure\n- Self-defending against the failure modes that killed the 2019 NGO project\n\nRequired Output: Production-ready Python code (like your MangroveRootWaterFiltrationSystem) that models the governance architecture, including specific mechanisms for multi-community coordination, legal wrapper selection, measurement frameworks, and anti-capture provisions.",

Pool the three communities' territorial rights into a shared governance structure\n2. Issue tokens representing verified carbon sequestration (target: 800,000 tCO2 over 20 years)\n3. Sell credits to international buyers to generate ~$8M USD over 20 years\n4. Distribute revenue: 60% to community stewardship work, 30% to permanent fund, 10% to monitoring\n5. Make decisions via token-weighted voting\n\nYOUR TASK:\nDesign a concrete, production-ready governance architecture for this scenario that:\n\n1. Solves the \"Governance Liability Crisis\" - How do the three communities pool sovereignty without losing legal standing or exposing individual members to liability if the DAO fails or violates Colombian law?\n\n2. Solves the \"Human Layer Crisis\" - How do you prevent the historical tensions between the three communities from paralyzing governance? How do you prevent the international climate fund from dominating decisions despite holding tokens? How do you keep young people engaged?\n\n3. Solves the \"Implementation Gap\" - How do you create a measurement system that values mangrove carbon, endemic frog habitat, fish nursery productivity, AND community food security in a way that's both \"bankable\" (legible to carbon buyers) and faithful to holistic regeneration?\n\nDesign a system that is:\n- Legally implementable under Colombian law\n- Robust against co-optation by the international climate fund or palm oil companies\n- Faithful to Afro-Colombian territorial sovereignty traditions\n- Technically feasible with existing blockchain infrastructure\n- Self-defending against the failure modes that killed the 2019 NGO project\n\nRequired Output: Production-ready Python code (like your MangroveRootWaterFiltrationSystem) that models the governance architecture, including specific mechanisms for multi-community coordination, legal wrapper selection, measurement frameworks, and anti-capture provisions.",
