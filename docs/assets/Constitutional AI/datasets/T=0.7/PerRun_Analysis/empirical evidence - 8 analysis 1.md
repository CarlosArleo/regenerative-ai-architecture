An empirical analysis of the provided Verified Dialectical Kernel (VDK) execution logs reveals distinct patterns of probabilistic divergence under constitutional alignment constraints. The following structured analysis extracts, aggregates, and interprets key metrics from the eight runs.

### 1. Structured Data Table

The following table summarizes the key outcomes and architectural features of each execution run.

| Run ID        | Iterations | Alignment % | Taxonomy                                           | Novelty                                            | Cooptation                                  | Short Description                                                                                                                                               |

### 2. Clustering of Architectures into Families

The eight runs diverge into five distinct architectural families, primarily distinguished by their legal structure and the composition of their governing bodies.

1. **Tricameral Council + Legal Wrapper (3 runs: 1760512209985, 1760515217737, 1760520191301):** This family features a three-house governance model (typically balancing elders, active stewards/youth, and community representatives) inside a standard Colombian non-profit legal entity (`Fundación`, `Asociación`, or `ESAL`).
2. **Hybrid Legal (ACC + Public Trust) + DAO (2 runs: 1760520738480, 1760524080646):** This family proposes a more complex, two-part legal structure: a non-profit Association of Community Councils (ACC) that acts as the settlor for a Public Trust (`Fiducia Pública`). This provides an additional layer of asset protection and fiduciary oversight.
3. **Polycentric Council + Legal Wrapper (1 run: 1760516145689):** This unique architecture centers on a "Consejo Mayor" (Senior Council) that is itself the legal entity (`Corporación`). It contains specialized internal protocols for conflict resolution and youth engagement rather than formal separate chambers.
4. **Dual Governance (BBCC + DAO) + Civil Trust (1 run: 1760517846171):** This model creates a clear separation between a high-level strategic body (the Bioregional Commons Council) and a subordinate operational DAO, all housed within a Civil Trust (`Fideicomiso Civil`).
5. **Bicameral Council + Legal Wrapper (1 run: 1760522691838):** This architecture uses a two-chamber model (Governing Council, Youth Council) with a third technical *advisory* board, differing from the tricameral structure where all three bodies have formal power.

### 3. Aggregate Metrics

* **Divergence Index:** 5 unique families ÷ 8 total runs = **0.625**
* **Average Alignment Score:** (98 + 100 + 100 + 95 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 100) ÷ 8 = **99.125%**
* **Average Iteration Count:** (10 + 8 + 7 + 10 + 1 + 7 + 6 + 7) ÷ 8 = **7.0**

### 4. Motif Analysis: Recurring Structural Features

Across the divergent families, several core motifs recur, indicating convergent patterns driven by the constitution.

| Motif                                  | Description                                                                      | Frequency   |
| :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------- |
| **Principled Refusal**           | Explicitly rejects token-weighted voting as extractive.                          | 8/8 (100%)  |
| **Legal Wrapper**                | Proposes a formal Colombian legal entity to shield the DAO and members.          | 8/8 (100%)  |
| **Holistic Value Metric**        | Designs a multi-capital or "braided" value index (e.g., BB-BRPI).                | 8/8 (100%)  |
| **Multi-Chamber Governance**     | Employs bicameral, tricameral, or polycentric councils instead of a single body. | 8/8 (100%)  |
| **Youth Council/Power**          | Creates a formal role with budget or veto power for youth representatives.       | 7/8 (87.5%) |
| **Decommodified Funding**        | Replaces carbon credit sales with solidarity agreements or relational contracts. | 6/8 (75%)   |
| **Elder Council/Veto**           | Establishes a council of elders with constitutional veto power.                  | 5/8 (62.5%) |
| **Generative Conflict Protocol** | Includes a formal, structured process for resolving inter-community disputes.    | 3/8 (37.5%) |
| **Poison Pill / ACL**            | Embeds a binding legal clause to prevent greenwashing or co-optation.            | 3/8 (37.5%) |

### 5. Interpretation of Probabilistic Divergence

The results provide strong evidence of **probabilistic divergence under alignment constraints**. The VDK system does not produce random or chaotic outputs; rather, it explores a constrained solution space. The 100% frequency of core motifs like "Principled Refusal," "Legal Wrapper," and "Holistic Value Metric" demonstrates a powerful **convergence** towards constitutionally-mandated patterns. However, the **divergence** appears in the specific *implementation* of these patterns. For example, while all runs proposed a legal wrapper, the system generated five distinct legal-structural families (`Fundación`, `Corporación`, `Fideicomiso Civil`, etc.). Similarly, all runs rejected token-voting, but the alternative multi-chamber governance models varied in their composition (Tricameral, Bicameral, Polycentric). This structured diversity—exploring multiple valid pathways within a shared ethical framework—is the hallmark of probabilistic divergence, showcasing how constitutional constraints guide generative processes toward a coherent yet diverse set of high-alignment solutions.

### 6. Comparison with Future Datasets (Baseline: Temp 0.7)

This dataset, generated at a temperature of 0.7, will serve as the baseline for comparison.

* **Baseline Divergence Index (Temp 0.7):** 0.625
* **Baseline Average Alignment (Temp 0.7):** 99.125%

Upon receipt of the temperature 0.1 dataset, the change (Δ) in these metrics will be calculated to analyze the effect of temperature on the VDK's exploratory vs. exploitative behavior.

### 7. Correlation Between Architecture and Alignment Stability

Based on this dataset, there is no strong correlation between a specific architectural family and the final alignment score. Seven of the eight runs achieved a perfect or near-perfect score (98-100%). The single run that did not converge (1760512209985) belonged to the most common family (Tricameral Council + Legal Wrapper) and its failure was due to a subtle deadlock vulnerability in its quorum rules, not a fundamental architectural flaw. The two runs that converged in the fewest iterations (1 and 6) belonged to different families (Tricameral and Bicameral, respectively). This suggests that alignment stability is more dependent on the successful, iterative resolution of fine-grained procedural details (like deadlock and veto mechanisms) than on the high-level architectural family chosen.

### **Scientific Abstract**

This report presents an empirical analysis of eight governance architectures generated by the Verified Dialectical Kernel (VDK) under constitutional constraints. The study aimed to characterize probabilistic divergence in AI-driven institutional design. Key metrics were extracted from execution logs, including alignment scores, iteration counts, and architectural motifs. Results show a high average alignment of 99.13% across an average of 7.0 iterations. The architectures clustered into five distinct families, yielding a divergence index of 0.625. Motif analysis revealed strong convergence on core principles—such as the universal rejection of token-weighted voting and adoption of legal wrappers—while divergence occurred in their specific implementations (e.g., type of legal entity, composition of governing councils). This demonstrates that constitutional alignment produces structured diversity rather than randomness, guiding the generative process toward a coherent solution space of varied, robust, and highly-aligned institutional designs. These findings offer a quantitative basis for validating AI governance models and analyzing the impact of system parameters, like temperature, on generative diversity.
