# VDK Batch Analysis Reports (T=0.7)

This repository contains three batch analysis reports examining the behavior of a Value-Driven Knowledge (VDK) system at high creative temperature (T=0.7). The system was tasked with generating governance architectures for a Colombian territorial commons, rejecting extractive tokenomics in favor of equitable, community-centered designs.

## What's Inside

Each batch analyzes 6 execution runs (18 total) at T=0.7, documenting:

* **Structured Exploration** : How elevated temperature enables the system to explore more radical architectural variations, including one complete failure to converge (50% alignment)
* **Constitutional Convergence** : Despite higher temperature, 100% consistency on non-negotiable motifs across successful runs (rejection of token-weighted voting, elder veto power, Colombian legal wrappers, youth mechanisms, holistic value measurement)
* **Architecture Families** : Classification into 2-5 distinct families per batch (bicameral veto, tricameral council, hybrid legal+DAO, polycentric commons, dual governance+civil trust, non-market trust)
* **Stability vs. Novelty Trade-offs** : Analysis of how increased temperature affects convergence speed, iteration counts, and the emergence of radical innovations

## Dataset Metrics

* **Total Runs** : 18 (across 3 batches)
* **Average Alignment** : 96.6% (excluding failed run: 98.8%)
* **Average Iterations** : 4.9
* **Divergence Index Range** : 0.33 - 0.83
* **Failed Convergence** : 1/18 (5.6%)

## Key Findings

**Higher Temperature = Greater Exploration + Higher Risk**

* The system generates more structurally diverse solutions and explores radical economic models (e.g., "Pacto de Reciprocidad" rejecting all market mechanisms)
* One run completely failed to converge, suggesting some solutions are too divergent to reconcile with constitutional constraints
* Successful runs still achieve 95-100% alignment, proving constitutional guidance remains effective even under high creative freedom

**Convergence Patterns**

* Simpler architectures (bicameral, basic tricameral) converge in 1-4 iterations
* Complex innovations (polycentric commons, novel economic models) require 7-10 iterations
* The only failed run attempted the most radical departure from conventional governance structures

**Architectural Diversity**

* Batch-to-batch variation in family clustering (0.33 to 0.83 divergence index) suggests temperature introduces meaningful stochasticity
* All successful architectures share identical core motifs despite radical structural differences
* Novel mechanisms range from incremental (certification seals) to transformative (complete market rejection)

---

*This dataset demonstrates that constitutional constraints can guide creative exploration even at high temperatures, though with increased risk of convergence failure when solutions become too radical.*
